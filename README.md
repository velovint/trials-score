## TODO
* Group entries on leaderboard by class
* Sort entries on leaderboard by completed laps (desc), points (asc), name (asc)
* Move Clear button to top menu
* Page title on score entry page
* Score formatter that can be shared between list and entry
* How to use DI?
* ~Move score updating and merge logic out of ScoreCardViewModel. Not sure where it should be though~
* ~Add SectionScoresRepository and move load or create scores logic in it~
* ~Update score calculation to ignore not scored sections~
* ~Reset database between integration tests~
* ~Integration test for creating new rider record~
* ~Create new rider with empty score card~
* ~Reset score card: delete all entries in DB~
* ~Create new score card for rider - 10 sections with -1 points committed to the DB~

## Future ideas
* Export event results to Excel
* Import rider list from CSV (Name, Class)
* Configurable classes
* Split sections in to laps and enter one lap at a time
